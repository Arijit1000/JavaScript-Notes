# JavaScript-Notes
This is everything you need to know about the language of the future, Javascript!

## Purpose
This is my attempt at sharing JS knowledge with everyone. Figured this would be a better way of documenting my journey.

## Contributions
If you have notes of your own, and interested in contributing to this repo, hit a PR! I'll review it and add it immediately.
